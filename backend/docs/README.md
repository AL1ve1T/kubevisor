# kubevisor.backend Documentation

`kubevisor.backend` is a Kubernetes observability backend. It ingests OpenTelemetry
telemetry emitted by demo workloads, transforms raw traces and metrics into a live
service-topology graph, aggregates rolling per-edge metrics, and publishes
frontend-ready graph snapshots over REST and Server-Sent Events (SSE).

This is a **domain-specific topology-processing backend** for Kubernetes workload
visualization — not a generic observability platform. It deliberately does not
replace Jaeger, Tempo, or Prometheus, and it does not store raw spans.

## What this backend does

```
OTLP traces  ─┐
              ├─► parse ─► normalize ─► resolve topology ─► aggregate ─► publish (REST + SSE)
OTLP metrics ─┘                                              │
(Beyla flows,                                                └─► persist (24h+ history)
 kubeletstats)
```

- **Receives** OTLP/HTTP payloads: distributed traces, Beyla network-flow metrics,
  and kubeletstats resource metrics.
- **Parses** spans and metric data points into internal records.
- **Normalizes** spans into `InteractionEvent` objects (direction-resolved edges).
- **Resolves** source/destination workload relationships and node types.
- **Aggregates** per-edge metrics (RPS, latency, error rate) as instantaneous
  per-second values and maintains live in-memory graph state.
- **Enriches** nodes with pod health (phase, restart count) and CPU/memory load.
- **Publishes** per-namespace `GraphSnapshot` objects via REST and SSE.
- **Persists** snapshots for historical replay with a rolling retention window.
- **Cleans up** stale nodes and edges automatically.
